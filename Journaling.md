#### Sprucing Up Your Weekly Journal with Fun Tricks:

Let's explore some neat ways to add a touch of creativity to your weekly task or achievement journal using simple markdown techniques.

<br>

**I. Clear Titles**  
Ever noticed how chapters in a book have titles? Markdown lets you do the same thing. Make your journal organized by adding headings. Just use a "#" symbol before a sentence, like this:

```r
# Main Title
## Subtitle
### Tiny Subtitle
#### Even Tinier Subtitle
```

This will create headings like:

# Main Title
## Subtitle
### Tiny Subtitle
#### Even Tinier Subtitle

**II. Highlighting Text**  
Want to emphasize a word? Markdown makes it easy. Make a word italic or bold to make it stand out. It's like giving it a special spotlight!

```r
*italic*
**bold*
```
*italic*  
**bold**


<br>

**III. Adding Pictures**  
Imagine sticking a photo into your journal. Markdown can do that too. Just use this code:

```r
![Description](Image_URL)
```
![journal](https://images.pexels.com/photos/636243/pexels-photo-636243.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800)
Replace "Description" with a short note about the picture and "Image_URL" with the web link of the picture. Your journal will come alive with images.

**IV. Adding Links**  
Remember clicking on links in websites? You can add them to your journal too! You can also even link a file. It's like having a secret door to more info. Just type:

```r
[Click Here](Link_URL)
[Click to Download](File_URL)
```

Replace "Click Here" or "Click to Download" with the text you want to click on and "Link_URL" with the web address of the website or the file. Connect external information to your journal!

<br>

**V. Inserting a Table**  
Tables help organize info neatly. Want to keep track of tasks? You can make a simple weekly to-do list in your journal using markdown. Like this:

```r
| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| Task   | Task    | Task      |
```
| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| Task   | Task    | Task      |

Fill in the days and tasks to make your own calendar.

**VI. Adding Videos to Your Markdown Document:**  

Markdown itself doesn't support native video embedding due to its primary focus on text formatting. However, some platforms allow a workaround to include videos using specific Markdown syntax.

For instance, on platforms like GitHub, you can embed a YouTube video using the following Markdown syntax:

```r
[![Video](VIDEO_THUMBNAIL)](VIDEO_URL)
```
[![Video](VIDEO_THUMBNAIL)](https://vimeo.com/178485416)

Replace VIDEO_THUMBNAIL with the thumbnail image URL and VIDEO_URL with the video URL. The result will be an image that, when clicked, links to the video.

Give these tricks a go, and you'll make your journal a lively and engaging record of your week!
